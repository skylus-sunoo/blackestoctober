 ger_stasi.1.d:0 "As dawn broke over the horizon, smoke could be seen rising over the American Army base known as "Hohenfels", the end result of a fierce raid conducted by Stasi guerilla fighters. Taken by surprise, the American troops on the base had to scramble to counter the raiders, and despite being able to fight them off with minimal casualties and injuries, many weapons and vehicles were stolen and are yet to be recovered.\n\nWith the dust settled, the dead counted, and what remaining equipment on-base being recounted, fingers are being pointed in all directions on who is to blame. While it is certain that it was a Stasi remnant group who committed the raid, how such an endeavor managed to slip by both American and German intelligence is still a mystery. The Americans claim that the German government was sweeping the Stasi remnants under the rug, while the Germans claim that the Americans should have better fortified their bases."

 rcw_report.1.d:0 "Following the Order of "National Restoration of Peace & Tranquility" by Boris Yeltsin, the result was brutal. . .and yet, not enough. This would soon backfire harshly, as the Supreme Monarchist Council, formed by Stanislav Dumin, would form the "Volunteer Army of Central Russia", reminiscent of the Russian Civil War, painting themselves as practically a heir to the White-Army. They donned practically re-enactor uniforms, but brandishing Kalashnikovs, Tokaervs and other more modern, or just more available weaponry.\n\nThis would quickly devolve into mass-fighting, as these "Volunteers" surprised the Loyalist forces, ambushing them form rooftops, narrow streets, and much else. Utilizing Molotov cocktails, and other forms of improvised explosives, the Russian Army would find itself forced to a halt. And soon enough, into retreat. Followed by this show of force by the Tsarists; Hard-line Communists, National-Bolsheviks and others, formed their own volunteer units, albeit, each forming their own organization, all would agree that officially at least, they would be a part of the Volunteer Army of Central Russia. Everyone except the Left, that is, which saw it as a reactionary force, instead calling themselves the Second Red Army.\n\nBy all means of purpose, definition and need; Moscow is no longer a safe territory. Now, it is a full on warzone, as quite literally stolen tanks find themselves flying Tsarist tricolors, Soviet banners and other flags, united in only one cause. Their defiance, to the rule of Dictator Yeltsin. In their eyes at least. What shall follow this show of force by the Front of National Salvation, is yet to be seen."

 #rcw_news.1.d:0 "Today, marks the beginning of the end, of civil order in Russia. While some thought, Yeltsin might still prevail, those hopes have ended today. The Kremlin Guard regiment, seeing the Soviet Union fall, Russia go down like this, and now, the old Tsarist forces making their way back, could not handle it all. The Kremlin Guard regiment, would once, in their entire history, break their oath. The Kremlin Palace, the former seat of the President; would be secured by it's own guards, and the Russian tricolor would be flown down. And in it's stead, would rise the old tricolor, the black, yellow, white one. To the horror of all Yeltsinists, Communists and others, it would not be some popular entity to take over the Kremlin, but it's own guard. And they would do so, for the Tsar.\n\nOf course, both Dumin and Rutskoy, one leading the Tsarists, one the whole Parliamentary block; would be quick to capitalize on this. Dumin by holding a speech from the Kremlin, calling upon all "True Patriots of Russia" to rise up and depose the Yeltsinite 'gang', while Rutskoy would quickly ensure a photoshoot, to make himself look like the more legitimate of the Russian Presidents. However, neither of this would be as important as the fall of the Kremlin itself. With it, commands to Moscow Loyalists can no longer be sent; and Yeltsin has evacuated to Petrograd.\n\nFor all intents and purposes however, there is much bigger of a result here. The fact, that by the end of that day, Moscow, had officially fallen. The Soviet banner, the Tsarist Tricolor, and much else, has resulted in the unthinkable. Yeltsin has lost his very throne."
